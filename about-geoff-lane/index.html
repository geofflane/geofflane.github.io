<p>
  I'm Geoff Lane and I write Zorched.net as I figure things out about software
  development in the hopes that it can help other people facing similar
  situations. Also as a thanks to the larger web community for all of the
  information and knowledge that they have shared. I've been a professional
  software developer since 1999 working with a variety of different
  technologies. I've worked for startups in the Silicon Valley and Chicago, IL
  and a consulting firm in Milwaukee, WI. Now I work as a consultant in
  Cincinnati, OH building custom software for clients.
</p>
<h3>Professional</h3>
<p>Software designer and developer, polyglot, metaprogrammer, defender of Agile practices, writer of Unit Tests, practitioner of refactoring.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fluent:</strong> Elixir, Ruby, Java, C#, Groovy</li>
  <li><strong>Conversational:</strong> JavaScript, Scala, Go, bash</li>
  <li><strong>Familiar:</strong> Scheme, Haskell, Clojure, Objective-C (Cocoa), C, C++, Erlang</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm interested in a lot of different things I guess &mdash; OO,
  Functional, Dynamically Typed and Statically Typed Languages. I like proven
  technologies but keep up with new ones too. Mostly I like to know when it's
  appropriate to use any technology. I prefer Unixy systems like Mac OS X and
  Linux. I prefer Elixir over Ruby, Ruby over Scala over Java (and everything else over .NET), but
  I know and have used all of the above. I use Vim because it's awesome.

<h3>Personal (but not too Personal)</h3>
<p>
  Currently living in Windso, ON. Previously in Cincinnati Ohio, Milwaukee Wiscone and in Chicago Illinois
  prior to that. I live with my wife, son, and two cats. Prior to Chicago did a stint in the
  Silicon Valley during the tail end of the .COM boom. I have lived in Ohio
  (twice), Wisconsin, Illinois, Texas, Virginia, and California (twice). Love
  metal (<a href="http://www.darkesthour.cc/">Darkest Hour</a>, Lamb of God,
  Job for a Cowboy, Three Inches of Blood, The Black Dahlia Murder, Arsis) and I
  especially love Swedish Metal (<a href="http://www.the-haunted.com/">The
    Haunted</a>, <a href="http://www.inflames.com/">In Flames</a>, At The
  Gates, <a href="http://www.darktranquillity.com/">Dark Tranquility</a>, Amon
  Amarth). But I like other music too: Johnny Cash, John Coltrane, Bob Dylan. I
  grow a small garden so I have useable skills after the zombie apocalypse. I
  enjoy traveling &mdash; I've been to twelve foreign countries and
  hope to visit more.
