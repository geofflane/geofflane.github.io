  content: "Hey, i tried to go through your examples but come across this issue:\r\nNo
    signature of method: static org.codehaus.groovy.grails.validation.ConstrainedProperty.registerNewConstraint()
    is applicable for argument types\r\n\r\nthis happens when i add:\r\norg.codehaus.groovy.grails.validation.ConstrainedProperty.registerNewConstraint(PhoneNumberConstraint.PHONE_NUMBER_CONSTRAINT,
    PhoneNumberConstraint.class) to the Config.groovy class. \r\n\r\nAny idea how
    i could get past it...?\r\nthanks!"

<p>In my previous post I wrote about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zorched.net&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;25&#47;build-a-custom-validator-in-grails-with-a-plugin&#47;">Building a Custom Validator in Grails using a Plugin<&#47;a>. That's a great way to build a reusable Constraint that will allow you to share your code among multiple projects. But often you only have one application that you are building, or a validator is a very domain specific thing that will only make sense in a single app.</p>
<h3>Building the Constraint in a Single App<&#47;h3><br />
<em>Please look at the previous post for the details of the Plugin.<&#47;em><br />
As I mentioned in that post a plugin looks almost exactly like a Grails App. Just like in the plugin case, your grails app has a <em>src&#47;groovy<&#47;em> and a <em>src&#47;java<&#47;em> directory where you can put general code. In this case I wrote the Constraint in the <em>src&#47;groovy<&#47;em> directory as I wanted to use the Groovy language and some of the fun dynamic techniques it offers.</p>
<h3>Hook it into the App<&#47;h3><br />
Here's the simple part. The goal, as we saw in the plugin example, is to register your custom Constraint with the Grails <em>ConstrainedProperty<&#47;em> class. I just took a guess on this one and it worked. Grails provides the<br />
<em>Config.groovy<&#47;em> class to setup a bunch of things in your application. So all you need to do is add the <en>ConstraintProperty<&#47;em> configuration to your <em>Config.groovy<&#47;em> script and your application will have a new constraint:</p>
<p><strong>Config.groovy<&#47;strong><br />
<code><br />
org.codehaus.groovy.grails.validation.ConstrainedProperty.registerNewConstraint(<br />
    PostalCodeConstraint.POSTAL_CODE_CONSTRAINT, PostalCodeConstraint.class)<br />
<&#47;code></p>
<p>Have fun building your own Constraints!</p>
