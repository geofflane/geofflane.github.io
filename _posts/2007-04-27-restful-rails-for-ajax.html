<p>Ruby on Rails 1.2 added full support for building RESTful services to the already nice web page support. REST is a conceptually simple idea, yet incredibly powerful. REST is a Web based API to an application. It builds on the basic building blocks of HTTP: URLs and HTTP Methods (think verbs).</p>
<p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) uniquely identifies a resources on the web. HTTP uses the concept of Methods to give context to a request to a URL. Most developers will be familiar with a GET and a POST. These methods are used to get a resource and to modify a resource respectively. But there are <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">other http verbs</a> as well. The two other interesting ones for a REST service are PUT and DELETE. Both of these are pretty self explanatory. PUT creates a resource at the remote location and DELETE removes one.</p>
<p>For Example:
GET
http://example.com/catalog/item/1</p>
<p>DELETE
http://example.com/catalog/item/1</p>
<p>Both of these use the same URL, but the HTTP Method means different things will happen.</p>
<h3>Creating A RESTful API with Rails</h3>
Rails makes it easy to create a RESTful application. The same controllers can be used to render a web page and to provide a programmatic API to your application.</p>
<p>Rails provides a <em>scaffold_resource</em> generator that creates the skeleton of a resource driven application:
{% highlight bash %}
./script/generate scaffold_resource order
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This creates Model, View and Controllers just like regular scaffold, but unlike scaffold, it adds some extra functionality.
{% highlight ruby %}
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  # GET /orders/1
  # GET /orders/1.xml
  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])<
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # show.rhtml
      format.xml  { render :xml => @order.to_xml }
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Now if you request a path ending in <em>.xml</em> it will render the response as an XML document that can be consumed by another program.</p>
<h3>Applying REST as an Ajax solution</h3>
The great news is that you can use this RESTful API directly as an API to use for building a highly-dynamic Ajax application. (See my post on <a href="http://www.zorched.net/2006/10/30/ajax-with-json-using-php-and-dojo/">using Ajax with PHP</a> for an example). But what's even cooler is that you can use the same technique to build a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> API. JSON is much easier and less resource intensive to consume in an Ajax application than XML.</p>
<p>Changing your controller to support JSON ends up being really easy. All you have to do is add a single line in the respond_to block to support it:
{% highlight ruby %}
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  # GET /orders/1
  # GET /orders/1.xml
  # GET /orders/1.js
  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # show.rhtml
      format.xml  { render :xml => @order.to_xml }
      format.js { render :json => @order.to_json }
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Just like in the XML example, if you make a request that ends in
  <em>.js</em> then you will get a response rendered as JSON. Consuming that
  JSON Service with something like Dojo allows you to easily create a dynamic
  web application.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
dojo.require("dojo.event.*");
dojo.require("dojo.io.*");
dojo.require("dojo.date.*");
dojo.require("dojo.lfx.*");
function getOrder(id) {
    dojo.io.bind({url: "/orders/" + id + ".js", handler: showOrder, mimetype: "text/json"});
}</p>
function showOrder(type, data, evt) {
    dojo.dom.removeChildren(dojo.byId('order'));
    appendOrderPart('order_number', data.attributes.order_number);
    appendOrderPart('time', data.attributes.time);
    dojo.lfx.highlight(dojo.byId('order'), dojo.lfx.Color);
}
function appendOrderPart(id, value) {
    var element = document.createElement("div");
    element.id=id;
    element.innerHTML=value;
    dojo.byId('order').appendChild(element);
}
function init() {
  getOrder(1);
}
dojo.addOnLoad(init);
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
With a few simple lines of code you can not only render a web page, you can
also create an XML API and a JSON API. That's what I call developer
friendly!</p>
