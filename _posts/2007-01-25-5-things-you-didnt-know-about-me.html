<p>Well thanks to <a href="http://www.distribucon.com/blog">Dan</a> I've been tagged for 5 things you didn't know about me. So, I'll take a deviation from my normal technical blogging and both of you (rimshot!) some interesting tidbits of information about me.</p>
<ol>
<li>I've never lived anywhere for more than 5 years in my entire life. I've lived in 8 different cities in 6 different states in the US (California twice, Texas, Virginia, Ohio, Illiniois, and Wisconsin).</li>
<li>I played guitar in a heavy metal/hardcore band in college called Entrust.</li>
<li>I was a <a href="http://www.nationalmerit.org">National Merit Finalist</a> in high school. Of course then I went to a public college and wasted all of my potential.</li>
<li>I have a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. (Ok, you could find that out by reading my Resume.) My Calculus teacher in high school recommended it when I had no idea what I wanted to do.</li>
<li>I've never been to Canada or Mexico, but I'm getting married at the end of March and we're going to Mexico on our honeymoon. I promise to go to Canada some time soon.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>I guess in turn, I'll tag <a href="http://brennan.offwhite.net/blog/">Brennan</a>.</p>
