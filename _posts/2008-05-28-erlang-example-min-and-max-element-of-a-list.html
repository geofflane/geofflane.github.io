  content: "@faisal, This post was written 5 years ago. Erlang might have made changes
    since then...\r\nI think they've added core min/max functions and so what
    you're seeing is the compiler complaining that it can't tell which one you want
    to use. You need to export min/2, max/2 and call them as lists1:max and
    lists1:min (qualified function names)."

<p>This is part of a series on the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/course/exercises.html">Erlang Exercises</a> which is a great set of programming problems that challenge you to implement solutions to some common Erlang problems. I'm going to share some of my solutions to these problems.</p>
<h2>Simple recursive programs</h2><br />
1. Write a function lists1:min(L) which returns the mini- mum element of the list L.<br />
2. Write a function lists1:max(L) which returns the maximum element of the list L.</p>
<p><em>(I'm only showing the max version since the min is basically just the change of the guard clause.)</em></p>
<p><code lang="erlang"><br />
-module(mylists).<br />
-export([max/1]).<br />
max([H|T]) -><br />
    max(H, T).<br />
max(M, []) -><br />
    M;<br />
max(M, [H|L]) when M > H -><br />
    max(M, L);<br />
max(_M, [H|L]) -><br />
    max(H,L).<br />
</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3><br />
<strong>max([H|T])</strong><br />
This code is composed of a public, exported function and a private function. <strong>max([H|T])</strong> defines a function that takes a list. The slightly funny notation <strong>[H|T]</strong> is an operation that removes the head value (the zeroth element] from a list and assigns the head value to H and the remainder of the list to T. Think of the list as a stack, and you've just popped the stack. This method then delegates the remainder of the work to the internal, 2 value max function.</p>
<p><strong>max(M, [H|L]) when M > H -></strong><br />
This method is the main part of the internal, 2 value max function. The interesting piece here is <strong>when M > H</strong which in Erlang is known as a guard clause. This has to do with the pattern matching style of matching Erlang functions. It says "when M is less than H, call this function". It work in concert with <strong>max(_M, [H|L]) -></strong> which acts as a fall-through because the ones that don't match the first will call this. You can see those two functions take either M or H and pass that as the current Max value.</p>
<p><strong>max(M, []) -></strong><br />
The final piece of the internal max function is <strong>max(M, []) -></strong>. This is the end state of the function. The <em>[]</em> clause in the function arguments pattern matches an empty list. Based on those previous 2 parts of the function definition this is fulfilling the final case where the current max value has been compared to the last element in the list.</p>
<h3>Example</h3><br />
<code lang="erlang"><br />
List = [1,2,4,6,5].<br />
mylists:max(List).<br />
</code></p>
<p>So what happens is:</p>
<ol>
<li>max([1 | [2,4,6,5]])</li>
<li>max(1, [2 | [4,6,5]])</li>
<li>max(2, [4 | [6,5]])</li>
<li>max(4, [6 | [5]])</li>
<li>max(6, [5 | []]) when M > H</li>
<li>max(6, [])</li><br />
</ol></p>
