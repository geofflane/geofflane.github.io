<p>XML Serialization in the .NET Compact Framework seems to be buggy enough
  that it is generally not useful if you need to serialize a class that
  conforms to a schema of some sort. If all you need to do is serialize and
  deserialize representations of a class you are probably fine. But if you need
  to use the serialized data to interoperate with a service (for example) it
  likely will not work.</p>
<h3>Enums</h3>
I wrote previously about <a
  href="http://www.zorched.net/2006/12/21/bug-in-the-net-compactframework-xmlenum-with-whitespace/">Problems
  with Enum Serialization</a> on the .NET compact framework. To summarize: The
XmlEnum attribute allows you to change the value that is serialized. One of the
reasons to do this is to limit the valid values in the document. Of course,
Enums have naming restrictions such as not being able to have spaces in them.
So, one of the main reasons you would do this would be to put spaces in the
name that was serialized.</p>
<p>The problem is that the XmlEnum under the .NET Compact Framework truncates
  the value at the first space. So, in the example below your Enums would
  serialize to "Some" and "Another" instead of the correct "Some Value" and
  "Another Value".</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public enum Foo {
    [XmlEnum("Some Value")
    Some,
    [XmlEnum("Another Value")]
    Other
}
{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Controlling Serialization of Value Types</h3>
.NET has reference types and value types. Reference types are stored on the
heap and can be null. Value types are stored on the stack and can not be null.
What is a value type and what is a reference type is not always obvious. <code
  class="inline">int</code> and <code class="inline">double</code> are value
types but so is <code class="inline">DateTime</code>. <code
  class="inline">string</code> is a reference type though.</p>
<p>The serialization code is smart enough to not serialize null values. But
  what about those value types? They can not be null, so how do you determine
  if they should be serialized or not? There are two ways you can do it.</p>
<ol>
<li>DefaultValue</li>
<li><em>Property</em>Specified</em></li>
</ol> </p>
<h3>DefaultValue</h3>
One way is to specify a default value. If the property has that default value it will not be serialized.</p>
<p>Example:
{% highlight csharp %}
[XmlAttribute("age"), DefaultValue(-1)]
public int Age;
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>I have not found any problem with this on the .NET Compact Framework, but I haven't used it extensively.
DefaultValue really does not make sense for every case. What about a value
where negative, positive and zero all make sense? What about a boolean value
where true and false are both meaningful and different from null? Valid values
are really a business concept and many business concepts will not constrain
them in such a way that you can specify a DefaultValue to control
serialization, so this is not always useful.</p>
<p><em>See: <a href="http://www.distribucon.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,6bb6b064-6d03-4485-949c-04e679e51f5f.aspx">more information on DefaultValue</a></em>.</p>
<h3><em>Property</em>Specified</em></h3>
.NET serialization also allows you to specify a control value to check to see
if a property should be serialized. The form of the control value is
<em>propertyname</em>Specified. It is a boolean value. If the value is false,
then the property it controls will not be serialized. If the value, is true
then it will be serialized.</p>
<p>Example:
{% highlight csharp %}
[XmlIgnore]
public bool FooSpecified = false;</p>
<p>[XmlElement("foo)]
public int Foo {
    get { return this.foo; }
    set {
        this.foo = value;
        this.FooSpecified = true;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This is fine in the full framework. The problem is with the .NET Compact
  Framework. When the serializer comes across a <em>propertyname</em>Specified
  value that is false, the serialization of that class stops. This means if you
  have 5 properties and the second property has a control value set to false,
  only the first value will be serialized!</p>
<h4>Coming Soon</h4>
In a future post, I will write about how you can relatively easily write your
own XML Serializer for the .NET Compact Framework in about 500 lines of
code.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> follow-up post on <a
    href="http://www.zorched.net/2007/02/28/custom-xml-serialization-for-the-net-compact-framework/">Writing
    a Custom XML Serializer</a> has been posted.</p>
