<p>I was asked today "How do I find out the revision number of my Subversion
  directory?" and I didn't know the answer. The good news is there is an easy
  answer:
{% highlight bash %}svnversion . {% endhighlight %}</p></p>
<p>From the {% highlight bash %}svnversion help{% endhighlight %} command:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
The version number will be a single number if the working
  copy is single revision, unmodified, not switched and with
  an URL that matches the TRAIL_URL argument.  If the working
  copy is unusual the version number will be more complex:
</blockquote></p>
<p>This command takes a little while to run, because it runs against the remote
  repository as well. It gives more detailed results also such as whether or
  not you have local modifications or if the repository has been changed since
  your last update. These details can be interesting in certain cases. But
  sometimes all you want to know is what revision you currently have checked
  out...</p></p>
<p>If all you want to do is check on the current revision of your local working copy you can use some Unix magic to do that.
{% highlight bash %}grep revision .svn/entries |  awk -F\" '{print $2}'{% endhighlight %}</p></p>
<p>Redirect this output to a file or use it as an argument to a build script and you can have the revision number put into your application.
{% highlight bash %}ant -Drevision=grep revision .svn/entries | awk -F\" '{print $2}'{% endhighlight %}
<small>(notice the backticks ` and this needs to be on one line)</small></p></p>
<p>A little Unix scripting and voila!</p></p>
