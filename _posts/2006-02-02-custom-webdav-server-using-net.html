  content: "Kavitas,\r\nI built the WebDAV server using a custom IHttpModule. As I
    described, it was mapped to handle all incoming requests. When you get a Request
    you will have access to the HttpApplication object that contains both the incoming
    HttpRequest object as well as an HttpResponse object.\r\n\r\nThe HttpRequest object
    gives you access to all of the HTTP Header information. That header information
    will contain the kind of WebDAV request you are getting (PROPFIND, PUT, MOVE,
    COPY, GET). Using that information along with other information in the header
    such as the Path, the Depth, and possibly the Destination you have to fulfill
    that response.\r\n\r\nBasically there are a couple of different kinds of responses:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>PROPFIND
    for example responds with an XML document defining the resources available at
    a given path. Some basic headers are set (app.Request.Headers.Add(\"Content-Type\",
    \"text&#47;xml\")) and then the XML is written to the Request.Ouptut stream.<&#47;li>\r\n<li>COPY
    and MOVE don't write a response to the output stream, but generally just set HTTP
    Response Codes.<&#47;li>\r\n<li>GET Requests are just like a regular HTTP GET.
    The person is requesting the contents of a file. In that case you set the Response
    status code, set the Content-Type, and then just stream the contents of the file
    to the Response.Output stream.<&#47;li>\r\n<&#47;ol>\r\n\r\nAll of the specifics
    about the status codes and things are available at <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.webdav.org\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">www.webdav.org<&#47;a>. The Response status codes are really
    important for protocol compliance.\r\n\r\nHope That Helps."

    what I described building. I just provided some more information in my Response
    to Kavitas. Maybe that will help you out a bit?\r\n\r\nIf you have specific questions,

  content: "Kavitas,\r\nDid you map an HttpModule that you created in your site's
    Web.config? \r\n\r\nIn your Web.config:\r\n<code>\r\n<system.web>\r\n    <httpModules>\r\n
    \       <add name=\"DavModule\" type=\"Zorched.Dav.DavModule, DavModule\"&#47;>\r\n

    implements System.Web.IHttpModule. It's the code that gets the incoming request
    and then writes the response. You could start with something simple by just writing
    some plain-text back to the browser.\r\n\r\nIf you've already done that, then
    I would recommend looking at authentication and permissions. You shouldn't be
    getting a login prompt unless you have authentication enabled or you're trying
    to access something that your webserver doesn't have access to. Unfortunately,
    authentication an IIS are not an easy subject, so I don't know exactly what it
    could be."

    I would imagine that you just don't have any authentication going on. The User
    object is an IPrincipal. See the <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;library&#47;default.asp?url=&#47;library&#47;en-us&#47;cpref&#47;html&#47;frlrfSystemWebHttpApplicationPropertiesTopic.asp\"
    rel=\"nofollow\"> documentation of HttpApplication<&#47;a> for details. Basically,
    you can't create a log-in form, so you're going to have to use <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.faqs.org&#47;rfcs&#47;rfc2617.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Basic or Digest<&#47;a> authentication. Depending on your needs,
    I guess the built-in IIS Authentication might work (although I don't know if that
    will set the IPrincipal that you need), otherwise you are going to need to implement
    your own Authentication and set your own IPrincipal on each Request.\r\n\r\nJust
    for your info:\r\nBasic authentication sends the username and password in clear-text
    (technically base64 encoded) so should only be used over an SSL connection. Windows
    Explorer (in some versions) will not send Basic Authentication credentials over
    an non-secure connection."

    this.\r\n\r\n2. The code was done as a work-for-hire (I'm a consultant), so does

    is all you are going to get. You will need a way to query the database and get
    an item based on its virtual path. The WebDAV useage is probably very different
    from the how your other applications are using the database, so consider creating
    creating views or \"reporting tables\" to help make the data access easier.\r\n\r\n2,
    In .NET there is a System.Guid class that has a NewGuid method. For all pratical
    purposes you could use a few random characters, your host name and a timestamp
    or something like that if you weren't programming with a language that had easy

  content: "Stacy,\r\n1. Yes you will have to keep track of the lock status&#47;token
    for a given resource. You also have to check whether a resource is locked (and
    if the user supplies the proper lock token) for requests that modify the resource.
    The exact command are specified in the WebDAV RFC. This is easily done in a database
    or with a simple Hash structure mapping a resource to a lock. One caveat, a collection
    can be locked which means all of the children of that collection have an implied
    lock as well.\r\n\r\n2. lockdiscovery returns information about the lock. It can
    include things like who has the lock, when the timeout expires and the locktoken
    itself. The RFC also states: \"The server is free to withhold any or all of this
    information if the requesting principal does not have sufficient access rights
    to see the requested data.\" So, basically, don't give back the lock token to
    a user who should not be able to override that lock in some way."

    location to a drive letter) does not support locking. When you open an Office
    document, they are actually handed off to Office and Office uses its own WebDAV
    implementation to open it. The Office WebDAV supports LOCK and UNLOCK. \r\n\r\nI
    have not see applications that won't do a PUT. What happens if you drag and drop
    a TIFF file? Does it save then?\r\n\r\nIf you add a network location in 'My Network
    Places' and use a defined port or https, then you will uses the Office Web Folders
    all the time. When you do that, I've see it where you can't double-click non-Office
    files to GET them.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm coming to the conclusion that the Microsoft
    WebDAV implementations are pretty weak. I've had to open multiple support cases
    with Microsoft to get information on what deviations they have from the standard
    to work around them. You might need to do the same thing."

  content: "Geoff,\r\n\r\nI am in the process of completing a webdav server framework
    in C# and was wondering the best way to distribute the codebase to the public
    (I was initially thinking CodeProject or Sourceforge). I have been working on
    the framework for approx 1 week and am almost done (NDoc comments soon to come!).
    The framework will allow a developer to easily expose webdav server functionality
    for any custom solution (I am including a filesystem adapter example to show how
    easy it is to use).\r\n\r\nI decided to create this framework after being unable
    to find any good articles on the web regarding webdav and C# and also to webdav
    enable my company's Ayos File Managment System (formerly Spheros File Managment
    Server).\r\n\r\nLet me know!"

    From Internet Explorer you can also do File -> Open and use the HTTP path along

    not found on the server.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like your WebDAV client is probing to
    see if the resource exists.\r\n\r\nThe only command this doesn't apply to that
    I can recall is the LOCK command. A client can LOCK a non-existant resource. Basically
    they lock in anticipation of creating that resource to ensure that no one sneaks
    in and takes the name behind them."

    a web folder with a url like \"http:&#47;&#47;localhost:1067&#47;TemplateBusiness&#47;filelibrary\"
    it works great. The \"filelibrary\"-flag is found in the URL and therefore the

    yours, IE =), because I know it is) without even sending a request to my server!
    I log all requests, but there are no incoming requests at all! You have any ideas
    why this happens? What I know is that it got nothing to do with DNS or other problems,
    all other requests for web pages goes fine (and is logged).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    out of a word document. If I load a word document from my webdav server and then
    select file->Properties then MS word fires a PROPFIND back to my server asking
    for a \"save-profile-form-location\" property, and word load a single \"OK\" dialog
    that says \"Verifying Web Properties\".\r\n\r\nWord sends a PROPFIND request that

  content: "I'm adding this post because this blog post is the one I first saw when
    searching around for some code and information to help implement a webdav server.
    \ The solution I implemented will not suit everyone but for those that may benefit
    the code is on CodeProject (http:&#47;&#47;www.codeproject.com&#47;useritems&#47;NET_WebDAV_Server.asp).\r\n\r\nI've
    no doubt there's better code out there but it may give someone a head start. \r\n\r\nI
    think I've the answer to a couple of the questions posted here.  One is about
    being able to use a pretty file list that Excel and Word present when interacting
    with Sharepoint.  The short answer is that you can't.  Although Sharepoint is
    a WebDAV server, it's also Frontpage server and, in fact, the Office tools use
    the Frontpage RPC protocol when communicating with Sharepoint.  You can see this
    if you install Fiddler2 (www.fiddler2.com) a free local proxy implemented by a
    Microsoft employee that allows you to see all headers and body information sent
    to and received from an HTTP server.  Because this is a proprietary protocol,
    Microsoft can and do extend it to do things that are useful to them such as return
    a nice file listing.\r\n\r\nWhenever any of Microsoft's re-directors are used
    they will default to use Frontpage and this probably explains why the MS header
    must be returned in response to the OPTIONS verb.\r\n\r\nOne of the regular question
    is about installing a WebDAV server.  The example WebDAV server in the CodeProject
    article can be installed either at an IIS root or at a virtual directory.   In
    principle it shouldn't matter where the WebDAV is installed.  The Microsoft WebDAV
    clients will issue an OPTIONS request to the URL specified and issue a PROPFIND
    if the OPTIONS response is satisfactory.   If it's not, they will then query the
    web server root.  The chances are that this will generate a good response and
    so Excel or Word will try to work with it though the result amy not be what you
    expect.\r\n\r\nAs suggested here, the WebDAV server is implemented as a IhttpHandler
    so that the WebDAV serve can be installed using a wildcard map."

  content: "Hi\r\n\r\nI want to send documents generated  by a buisiness process to
    different clients by FTP over SSL. That applicaion is working fine. But a few
    of the clients do not have FTP server but using secure HTTP (WebDAV). I need to
    copy files from folders on local drive or IIS virtual folders to remote web site
    folders.\r\n\r\nThe code I found on MSDN is for copying files from one folder
    to another on the same web site.  In my case I need to copy it either from a local
    folder or virtual folder in localhost. In the MSDN code I couldn't figure out
    a way of providing different credential for accessing resources from localhost
    and remote host.\r\nCan someone help me to fix the code. Or can someone suggest
    a different way of doing it in .NET?\r\n\r\n[STAThread]\r\n      static void Main(string[]

<p>As I discussed in a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zorched.net&#47;2006&#47;01&#47;20&#47;aspnet-web-application-without-aspx-extension&#47;">previous post "ASP.NET Web Application without ASPX Extension"<&#47;a>, I've been working on a custom <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.webdav.org">WebDAV<&#47;a> server for a client. The initial proof-of-concept was just to see if we could get some .NET code that would respond to all paths for a given web application. From there I had to make WebDAV work.</p>
<h3>What is WebDAV<&#47;h3><br />
To recap: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.webdav.org">WebDAV<&#47;a> is an <abbr name="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF<&#47;abbr> Standard Protocol. It is an extension to the ubiquitous HTTP standard, adding on request methods to get property information about files and folders, make folders (called collections in WebDAV parlance), change properties, lock files, etc. Basically anything that you would want on a distributed file system. WebDAV is natively supported by Windows 2000 and XP, Mac OS X, and Linux (using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dav.sourceforge.net&#47;">davfs<&#47;a>). When using this native support, you're able to interact with WebDAV just like you are using a local filesystem or a network share. There are also many standalone client implementations that act more like FTP clients.</p>
<h3>Why Would You Write Your Own DAV Server?<&#47;h3><br />
Sharing files over a network is nothing new of course. Using Windows File Sharing, many people are used to using network shares to store files on a server and to share with their coworkers. The limitation of most of these file sharing systems is that they share exactly what is on the filesystem. What if you want to integrate file sharing with an application that stores file meta-data in a database? What if you want to programmatically control the files and folders that you show to your users? By building your own WebDAV server you can query a database to get all of the meta-data (and even file contents) to serve to your users.</p>
<h3>How To Build a WebDAV Server<&#47;h3><br />
I did quite a bit of searching and found WebDAV server implementation in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.comlounge.net&#47;webdav&#47;">Python<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;redhanded.hobix.com&#47;inspect&#47;webrickWebdavHandlerSafelyExtractedFromTheWild.html">Ruby<&#47;a>, and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jakarta.apache.org&#47;slide&#47;index.html">Java<&#47;a>, but could not find anything done in a .NET language which my client uses for all of their application infrastructure. So, I built one!</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zorched.net&#47;2006&#47;01&#47;20&#47;aspnet-web-application-without-aspx-extension&#47;">previous post<&#47;a>, we can take over the complete HTTP request for all requested paths. I use a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dofactory.com&#47;Patterns&#47;PatternCommand.aspx">Command Pattern<&#47;a> to handle the different types of WebDAV requests. The Commands are responsible for getting information from the HTTP Request that they need to fulfill the request and for writing the proper HTTP Response. Each of the Commands delegates the actual File manipulation to a set of provider classes. Those classes are accessed through an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dofactory.com&#47;Patterns&#47;PatternAbstract.aspx">Abstract Factory<&#47;a> which allows for me to easily change the backend implementation. This allows for a good separation of concerns. The WebDAV Service layer knows how to read and write WebDAV and the File Provider layer knows how to get and store information about files and folders. <em>(The abstraction between the Commands and the File Providers is a bit leaky still, but I'm confident I'll be able to refactor it into a cleaner separation.)<&#47;em></p>
<p>The first backend provider that I created for testing was a FileSystem provider. I've mapped the WebDAV server to a specific directory and use standard <code>System.IO<&#47;code> commands to manipulate files. This is a lot easier because it allowed me to focus on implementing the protocol without worrying about interacting with a less familiar data access layer.</p>
<h3>Test Your Implementation<&#47;h3><br />
The WebDAV folks have built a great test suite called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.webdav.org&#47;neon&#47;litmus&#47;">Litmus<&#47;a> that you can use to validate your server implementation. It performs all of the basic operations on files and collections to validate that the server performs to the specification. Start with Litmus and you've got your entire functional test harness written for you. That is some <abbr name="Test Driven Development">TDD<&#47;abbr> in action!<br />
Litmus goes a long way to get you to protocol compliance, but it took a bit of cleaning and tweaking before Windows Explorer would happily mount the Web Folder.</p>
<p>In addition to Litmus I found a couple of other tools really handy for debugging:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ethereal.com&#47;">Ethereal<&#47;a> - a very nice protocol analyzer that will let you inspect a series of requests and responses.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ics.uci.edu&#47;%7Ewebdav&#47;">DAVExplorer<&#47;a> - a Java WebDAV client that will write detailed logs of requests and responses.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Don't be afraid to write your own WebDAV server, it's really fun!</p>
