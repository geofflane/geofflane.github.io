  content: "Hiya... I disagree with your views on services. Services are great for
    all non-view preparation functionality. You should make controllers very thin
    like you say, but pushing too much functionality into domain classes is bad news,
    because even with logic related to a single domain class you may need to expose
    this functionality later as a SOAP, REST, XMLRPC or other service technology.
    \r\n\r\nOur domain classes are not anaemic - we put functionality related to the
    class in there in our apps, but typically this is very minimal on the basis that
    anything that is not just for preparing/managing the domain model is functionality
    and that may be exposed via many different outlets."

  content: "Marc,\r\nThanks for the comment. I don't mean to disparage using Services
    at all. It is of course a great way to share functionality. But whether logic
    is implemented in a Domain class or a Service, it can still be shared and exposed
    through multiple means.A Controller will most likely be used to expose those Services.
    Rendering an HTML page, XML for a REST service or other content is a content negotiation
    issue best managed by Controllers. That controller can interact with Domain objects
    or Services, whichever makes the most sense.\r\n\r\nI'm fighting the idea that
    everything needs to be encapsulated in a Service. In this mindset, Services often
    become simple pass-through objects that just add extra layers and more work without
    adding much value. Use Services when they make sense, but have a reason.\r\n\r\nEither
    way, thanks for the different perspective."

  content: "services, adding a layer that does nothing, just expose funcionality already
    implemented. I'm with Geoff, logic to the model. Do you wanna foo service? Use
    the controller for making simple calls to the model layer, the same model could
    be use for rendering anything.\r\n\r\n(I guess Marc cames from java world, and
    he hasn't try frameworks like grails or similar stuff that makes things so much
    easier)."

<p>There was a post on the Grails Mailing list today asking about the philosophy of Grails. This is my response:</p>
<p>I think I might have ripped this off from somewhere, but fundamentally there are 4 questions to answer for a basic application like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you display data to a User?</li>
<li>How do you implement business logic?</li>
<li>How do you encapsulate complex business logic (Domain) interactions?</li>
<li>How do you implement data access?</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Most of the time when there is a layered approach one of 2 things happen. You've implemented a Transaction Script pattern where your business logic is implemented in the Service layer, or your Services are thin wrappers around a Data Access layer. Transaction Script is fine, but doesn't handle complexity as well as a more Domain Driven, OO approach. The thin-wrapper thing is mostly just busy work and annoying to me.</p>
<p>In Grails:</p>
<ol>
<li>Controllers gather Data and hand it to GSPs for rendering</li>
<li>Business Logic goes in Domain Objects</li>
<li>Data Access goes in Domain Objects</li>
<li>Complex Interaction are encapsulated in Services</li><br />
</ol></p>
<h3>Thin Controllers</h3><br />
Keep your controllers thin so they just mediate between views and Domains.</p>
<h3>Active Record</h3><br />
2&3 happen in the same Domain objects because Grails implements the Active Record pattern. So, implement any extra queries in the Domain objects themselves.</p>
<h3>Services for Encapsulation</h3><br />
Only introduce a Service when you have complex interactions (multiple objects being constructed or working together to answer a question) among multiple Domain objects that need to be encapsulated.</p>
<p>This is a Domain Driven framework. The complexity should be encapsulated in your Domain Objects so you can use Polymorphism to manage complexity.</p>
