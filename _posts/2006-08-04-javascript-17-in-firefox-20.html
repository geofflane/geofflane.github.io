<p><a href="http://brennan.offwhite.net/">Brennan</a> posted a <a href="http://brennan.offwhite.net/blog/2006/07/19/firefox-2-almost-here/">blog entry about the Firefox 2.0 beta release</a> a couple of days ago that talks about a lot of the new features in the next Firefox release. This version seems to be an evolutionary release and not a revolutionary one. A lot of work has gone on in the internals of the code, and there are quite a few new developer fatures in this release, but there are still some really cool user centric features as well. Brennan talks a lot about the user features, so check them out. For more info, also look at the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_2_for_developers#New_features_for_end_users">new features for end users</a> that Mozilla provides.</p>
<p>I really want to look at some of the new features of Javascript though.</p>
<h2>Javascript 1.7</h2>
Javascript is a great language that people often dislike for a variety of
reasons. The main two reasons I've run across is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of understanding the features of the Javascript language</li>
<li>Frustration with incompatible DOM implementations in browsers</li>
</ol>
The incompatible DOMs is not really Javascript's fault of course, but it's
where a lot of the complexity comes in when you are writing client-side
Javascript code. So I definitely understand that frustration. But Javascript
itself is great (IMHO).</p>
<p>Javascript 1.7 is picking up a lot of new features that more popular
  scripting langauges have such as Ruby and Python. I've drawn comparison to
  Javascript and Ruby before and a number of the new features in Javascript 1.7
  only give them more feature parity.</p>
<h3>Generators</h3>
Javascript 1.7 adds a <code class="inline">yield</code> keyword. Yield allows
you leave a method of code and have the state of the method saved at that
point. When the method is called again, the last state of the code is resumed
(or continued) from the state of the last time the method was called. This is
often used for Iterators (another new feature). It can also be used to
implement things like <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation">Continuations</a> which can
be used to create state machines and parsers.</p>
<p>
{% highlight javascript %}
  function countdown() {
    yield 3;
    yield 2;
    yield 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<h3>Iterators</h3>
Building the the new Generator functionality, Javascript 1.7 is adding an <code
  class="inline">Iterator</code> object.  While previous versions of Javascript
have allowed you to iterate over Array's and the like using <code
  class="inline">for...each</code>, the Iterator allows you to build
  your own Iterator to iterate over any object that you create.</p>
<h3>Array comprehensions</h3>
Array comprehensions allow you to intialize an array taking advantage of the
Generator code. You can iterate over a collection of items inline to the Array
definition to populate the Array values.</p>
<p><code>var myArray = [ "Cool " + i for (i in range(0, 10))];</code></p>
<p>
{% highlight javascript %}
  function names() {
    yield "Geoff";
    yield "Bob";
    yield "Sue";
}
var nameArray = [ n + " is a name" for (n in names())];
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<h3>Multiple Return Values</h3>
A method can return multiple values and have those values assigned to
individual variables. This is an interesting feature found in Python. While you
can always create a wrapper object to return the values, or use a construct
like an Array, sometimes it is really handy to be able to just return multiple
things from a method. No <a
  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/csref/html/vclrfOut.asp">out
  parameters</a> needed.</p>
<p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var first, last;
[first, last] = ["Geoff", "Lane"]
document.write (first + " " + last + "\n");
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight javascript %}
function getPersonInfo() {
   return ["Geoff", 29];
}
var name, age;
[name, age] = getPersonInfo();
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<h3>let for Explicit Scoping</h3>
<code class="inline">let</code> allows you to define an explicit scope of a
variable.  Just like <code class="inline">var</code> makes a
variable so that it is not globally scoped, <code class ="inline">let</code>
narrows the scope to a defined block. This allows you to
redefine the value of a <code class="inline">var</code> (or
another <code class="inline">let</code>) variable to a more
        limited section of code, temporarily changing the value without
        effecting the value outside of that defined block.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
        var x = 1;
for (let x=0; x < 3; x++) {
    document.write("Value: " + x);
}
document.write("Value: " + x);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Lots of fun new features plucked from the best scripting and programming
  languages out there. The future looks bright for web client-side development.
  <small>(Of course IE won't support this stuff for 10 years
    probably.)</small></p>
