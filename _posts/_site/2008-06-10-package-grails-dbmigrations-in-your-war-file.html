<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dbmigrate/wiki/Grails">Grails DBMigrate Plugin</a> is a handy way to give you control over the generation of your database if you don't want Grails to auto-munge your schema. It works fine in development, but when you create a WAR for deployment on another machine the Migrations are not packaged in the WAR so the database can't be created or updated.</p>
<h3>Packaging DBMigrate Scripts for Deployment</h3>
Here's the quick solution to package your DBMigrations in your WAR file.</p>
<p>Just add this to your <strong>Config.groovy</strong> file and when you generate the WAR the migrations will be included and found by the Plugin.
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-groovy" data-lang="groovy"><span class="n">grails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">war</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">resources</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">stagingDir</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
    <span class="n">copy</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">todir:</span> <span class="s2">"${stagingDir}/WEB-INF/classes/grails-app/migrations"</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">fileset</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nl">dir:</span><span class="s2">"grails-app/migrations"</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure></p>
<h3>Aside</h3>
The only problem with DBMigrate is that it doesn't handle creating or updating Stored Procedures and Functions which means if you want to use those - for Reporting purposes lets say - you're out of luck currently. </p>
