<p>One of the great things about Rails and its community is that they are very lazy. Lazy in the good way of not wanting to do boring, repetitive, error prone things manually. They metaprogram and they automate. A great example of this is <a href="http://www.capify.org">Capistrano</a>. Capistrano allows you to deploy Rails applications with ease. The normal scenario is baked into Capistrano as a deployment convention and then you can customize it if you need to.</p>
<h3>My Story</h3>
I've recently redeployed a couple of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> sites using <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger (mod_rails)</a>. Passenger is an Apache module that really simplifies the deployment of small-scale Rails applications. Once Passenger is installed and your Rails application is set up as a virtual directory, it just works. Passenger auto-detects the fact that the directory is a Rails application and runs it for you. No need for a mongrel cluster or manually configuring load balancing.</p>
<p>I'm also using <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> as my version control system on small, personal projects because it's easy to use and I can work on multiple laptops and commit locally and worry about pushing to a central location when I have a network connection.</p>
<p>Seeing those things, I wanted to make them all work with Capistrano so that I could continue being lazy. To do this, I'm using Capistrano v2.4. It has Git support built in that works (some previous versions had support for Git, but seemed to have a lot of trouble).</p>
<h3>Git Setup</h3>
By convention, Capistrano uses Subversion. So, I need to change my configuration to use git. The <strong>set :scm, :git</strong> does this. The repository information sets up where my git repository lives. In this case, I'm just using a bare git repository accessing it over SSH. You can also access your repository using the git and http protocols if you have that setup. The <strong>branch</strong> just says to deploy off of the master branch. </p>
<p>That's pretty much it - nice and easy.

<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:repository</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"geoff@zorched.net:myapp.git"</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:branch</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"master"</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:deploy_via</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:remote_cache</span></code></pre></figure></p>
<h3>Passenger (mod_rails) Setup</h3>
The only thing that comes into play with Passenger is restarting the Rails application after a deployment is done. Passenger has an easy way to do this which is just to create a file called <strong>restart.txt</strong> in the Rails tmp directory. When it sees that, the Rails application process will be recycled automatically.</p>
<p>Doing this requires just a bit of Capistrano customization. We need to override the deploy:restart task and have it run a small shell script for us. In this case we are running <strong>run "touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt"</strong> to accomplish this task.</p>
<p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">namespace</span> <span class="ss">:deploy</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">desc</span> <span class="s2">"Restarting mod_rails with restart.txt"</span>
  <span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:restart</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:roles</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:app</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:except</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">:no_release</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">run</span> <span class="s2">"touch </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">current_path</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">/tmp/restart.txt"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure></p>
<p>We can also override the start and stop tasks because those don't really do anything in the mod_rails scenario like they would with mongrel or other deployments.
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:stop</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">desc</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> task is a no-op with mod_rails"</span>
    <span class="n">task</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:roles</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:app</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure></p>
<h3>The Whole Thing</h3>
Putting everything together in my <strong>deploy.rb</strong> looks like the following:
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:application</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"enotify"</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;

<span class="c1"># servers (which is the default), you can specify the actual location</span>
<span class="c1"># via the :deploy_to variable:</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:deploy_to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"/var/www/myapp"</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# If you aren't using Subversion to manage your source code, specify

    task t, :roles =&gt; :app do ; end
  end
end</span></code></pre></figure></p>
