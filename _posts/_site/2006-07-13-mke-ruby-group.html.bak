<p>The Milwaukee Ruby User's Group had it's first official meeting last night. A few people showed up and we talked about some of our favorite ruby features. I talked about <a href="http://www.devsource.com/article2/0,1895,1928561,00.asp">Metaprogramming</a> a bit. There was also a good discussion about the Ruby Object Model. (Classes are Objects and Object is a class - holy recursion!)</p>
