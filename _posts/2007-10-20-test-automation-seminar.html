<p>A long, long time ago in a land far away, I worked with my friend <a href="http://www.pushtotest.com">Frank Cohen</a> to help him build the first version of a Web Service and Web Application test tool that was called <a href="http://www.pushtotest.com/Docs/downloads/features.html">TestMaker</a>. Since then, Frank has made all kinds of improvements turning it into a really nice, graphical, scriptable testing tool. Frank has written books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFast-SOA-Architecture-scalability-performance%2Fdp%2F0123695139%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1192917822%26sr%3D8-1&tag=zorchednet-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Fast SOA</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zorchednet-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJava-Testing-Design-Automated-Tests%2Fdp%2F0131421891%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1192917839%26sr%3D1-5&tag=zorchednet-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Java Testing and Design</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zorchednet-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>
<p>Now Frank is putting on a <a href="http://www.pushtotest.com/Docs/training/seminarform/">Test Automation Seminar</a> covering a broad array of topics. He'll be talking about his own test-automation tool TestMaker, naturally, but he'll also be talking about others including <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a>. The seminar is going to cover a lot of currently hot technologies and techniques. In addition to general web-application testing, they are going to get into Ajax/Web 2.0 testing, REST and SOAP.</p>
<p>If you ever wanted to know more about functional test automation or performance and scalability testing, this might be a good, hands-on seminar to get you jump started. Check it out.</p>
<p>From Frank:</p>
<blockquote><p>
PushToTest is hosting a 2-Day seminar on open-source test automation. We will be covering load and scalability tests of Web applications, Ajax, Web 2.0, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA,) and functional testing of Windows and Java desktop applications. We will teach you TestMaker, soapUI, Glassbox, Selenium, and several other open-source tools.
