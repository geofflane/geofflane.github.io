  content: "Pietro,\r\n\r\ndoes this really setup tracking correctly? I had problems
    with that way when I modified that branch on a second computer. After I returned
    to the first computer where I initially setup the branch I tried to push some
    commited work and it told me, that the remote branch is somehow not compatible.
    But trying to merge the new commits into my local repo told me that there is no
    such remote head to sync with. Very strange. I had to rename my branch, merge
    the other branch into it and rebase it to commit it.\r\n\r\nNot sure if I did
    everything right because I am still pretty new to git and originally came from
    subversion. Git is so much nicer in many ways but the workflow is completly different
    if you want to use it as its full potential. So I may sometimes still to thing
    \"intuitively wrong\"."

    new branches so that git-pull(1)\r\n  will appropriately merge from that remote
    branch.  Recommended.  Without this,\r\n  you will have to add --track to your
    branch command or manually merge remote\r\n  tracking branches with \"fetch\"
    and then \"merge\"."

  content: "@kai &amp; @pietro (3 &amp; 4): (I know I'm late, but... just saw this)\r\n\r\nNo,
    this doesn't automatically add tracking (even with Nikos' hint). Just tried it.
    What you *can* do, is to edit the .git&#47;config file and add the following (after
    doing the push):\r\n\r\n  [branch \"new_feature\"]\r\n    remote = origin\r\n
    \   merge = refs&#47;heads&#47;new_feature\r\n\r\nYou can also do the same using
    git config:\r\n\r\n  git config branch.new_feature.remote origin\r\n  git config
    branch.new_feature.merge refs&#47;heads&#47;new_feature\r\n\r\nI tend to do the
    edit, though."

    to create the remote branch, is the second &acirc;&euro;&oelig;origin&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    correct? This is the <src> in the <src&gt:<dst&gt refspec, so I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d
    expect it to be a branch name such as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;master&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    or a revision name such as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;HEAD&acirc;&euro;\x9D. This would
    then be the point at which the new branch came off its parent, which is what would
    make sense to me.\r\n\r\nI stared at http:&#47;&#47;www.kernel.org&#47;pub&#47;software&#47;scm&#47;git&#47;docs&#47;git-push.html
    for a long time to understand what you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re doing here.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a great post and answered the question of how
    to create a branch in a remote respoitory and then use it, tracked, locally."

    makes sense to be a smallest group of file changes - I create a local branch.
    I commit to it - once I'm satisfied (unit&#47;functional test passed and all)
    I push changes to remote trunk.\r\n\r\nI rarely need to push my local branch to
    \"main\" git repository as a branch there - perhaps when there is 2+ of us working
    on the same thing..."

    name once.  :-)"

    pretty well referenced despite its age, I'll add my 2 cent of update :)\r\n\r\nThere
    is an easier way to do this since version 1.7.0 of git  (at least more understandable
    for my poor brain):\r\n1- Create the local branch from the current one\r\n<code
    lang=\"bash\">\r\ngit checkout -b new_feature\r\n<&#47;code>\r\n\r\n2- Push that
    branch to the remote\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">\r\ngit push origin new_feature\r\n<&#47;code>\r\nAt
    this stage your local branch is set to push to the remote but pull won't work\r\n\r\n3-
    Set the upstream branch to track\r\n<code lang=\"bash\">\r\ngit branch --set-upstream
    new_feature origin&#47;new_feature\r\n<&#47;code>\r\nNow you can both push to
    &#47; pull from the remote branch\r\n\r\n4- If you need to delete the remote branch\r\n<code
    lang=\"bash\">\r\ngit push origin :new_feature\r\n<&#47;code>"

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;git.or.cz&#47;">Git<&#47;a> is a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zorched.net&#47;2005&#47;12&#47;29&#47;what-are-decen&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;ontrol-systems&#47;">distributed version control system<&#47;a> so it allows you to create branches locally and commit against them. It also supports a more centralized repository model. When using a centralized repository you can push changes to it so that others can pull them more easily. I have a tendency to work on multiple computers. Because of this, I like to use a centralized repository to track the branches as I work on them. That way no matter what machine I'm on, I can still get at my branches.<&#47;p></p>
<h3>The Workflow<&#47;h3></p>
<p>My workflow is generally something like this:<&#47;p></p>
<ol>
<li>Create a remote branch<&#47;li>
<li>Create a local branch that tracks it<&#47;li>
<li>Work, Test, Commit (repeat) - this is all local<&#47;li>
<li>Push (pushes commits to the remote repository)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<p>Git commands can be a bit esoteric at times and I can't always seem to remember how to create a remote git branch and then start working on new code. There also seems to be multiple ways of doing it. I'm documenting the way that seem to work for me so that I can remember it. Maybe it will help someone else too.<&#47;p></p>
<h3>Creating a Remote Branch<&#47;h3></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create the remote branch<br />
<code lang="bash">git push origin origin:refs&#47;heads&#47;new_feature_name<&#47;code><&#47;p><&#47;li></p>
<li>
<p>Make sure everything is up-to-date<br />
<code lang="bash">git fetch origin<&#47;code><&#47;p><&#47;li></p>
<li>
<p>Then you can see that the branch is created.<br />
<code lang="bash">git branch -r<&#47;code><&#47;p><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<p>This should show 'origin&#47;new_feature_name'<&#47;p></p>
<ol>
<li>Start tracking the new branch<br />
<code lang="bash">git checkout --track -b new_feature_name origin&#47;new_feature_name<&#47;code><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<p>This means that when you do pulls that it will get the latest from that branch as well.<&#47;p></p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure everything is up-to-date<br />
<code lang="bash">git pull<&#47;code><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<h3>Cleaning up Mistakes<&#47;h3></p>
<p>If you make a mistake you can always delete the remote branch<br />
<code lang="bash">git push origin :heads&#47;new_feature_name<&#47;code><br />
<em>(Ok Git'ers - that has to be the least intuitive command ever.)<&#47;em><&#47;p></p>
<h3>Use the Branch from Another Location<&#47;h3></p>
<p>When you get to another computer or clone the git repository to a new computer, then you just need to start tracking the new branch again.<br />
<code lang="bash">git branch -r<&#47;code> to show all the remote branches<br />
<code lang="bash">git checkout --track -b new_branch origin&#47;new_feature_name<&#47;code> to start tracking the new branch<&#47;p></p>
<h3>Automate it A Bit<&#47;h3></p>
<p>That's a pretty easy thing to automate with a small shell script luckily<&#47;p></p>
<p><code lang="bash"><&#47;p></p>
<h1>!&#47;bin&#47;sh<&#47;h1></p>
<h1>git-create-branch <branch_name><&#47;h1></p>
<p>if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then<br />
         echo 1>&amp;2 Usage: $0 branch_name<br />
         exit 127<br />
fi<&#47;p></p>
<p>set branch_name = $1<br />
git push origin origin:refs&#47;heads&#47;${branch_name}<br />
git fetch origin<br />
git checkout --track -b ${branch_name} origin&#47;${branch_name}<br />
git pull<br />
<&#47;code><&#47;p></p>
