<p>Currently I have a whole bunch of <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> repositories in a directory. All of these are cloned from a central repository that the team pushes their changes to. I like to generally keep my local repositories up-to-date so that I can review changes. Manually running <em>hg incoming -R some_directory</em> on 20 different projects is a lot of work. So I automated it with a simple shell script.</p>
<p>This script will run incoming (or outgoing) on all of the local repositories and print the results to the console. Then I can manually sync the ones that have changed if I want.</p>
<p>I called this file <em>hgcheckall.sh</em> and run it like: <em>./hgcheckall.sh incoming</em>
{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash</p>
<p># Find all the directories that are mercurial repos
dirs=(`find . -name ".hg"`)
# Remove the /.hg from the path and that's the base repo dir
merc_dirs=( "${dirs[@]//\/.hg/}" )</p>
<p>case $1 in
    incoming)
    for indir in ${merc_dirs[@]}; do
        echo "Checking: ${indir}"
        hg -R "$indir" incoming
    done
    ;;
    outgoing)
    for outdir in ${merc_dirs[@]}; do
        echo "Checking: ${outdir}"
        hg -R "$outdir" outgoing
    done
    ;;
    *)
    echo "Usage: hgcheckall.sh [incoming|outgoing]"
    ;;
esac
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>I guess the next major improvement would be to capture the output and then automatically sync the ones that have changed, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.</p>
