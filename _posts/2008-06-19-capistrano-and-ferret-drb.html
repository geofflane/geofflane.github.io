<p>This is a bit of a followup to my previous post on <a href="http://www.zorched.net/2008/06/17/capistrano-deploy-with-git-and-passenger/">Capistrano with Git and Passenger</a>. I decided to use Ferret via the <a href="http://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/">acts_as_ferret</a> (<abbr title="Acts As Ferret">AAF</abbr>) plugin. <a href="http://ferret.davebalmain.com/">Ferret</a> is a full-text search inspired by <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Apache's Lucene</a> but written in Ruby.</p>
<p>Basically Ferret and Lucene keep a full-text index outside of the database that allows it to quickly perform full-text searches and find the identifers of rows in your database. Then you can go get those objects out of the database. It's pretty slick.</p>
<p>Ferret uses <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/drb/rdoc/index.html">DRb</a> as a means of supporting multiple-concurrent clients and for scaling across multiple machines. You really don't need to know much about DRb to use <abbr title="Acts As Ferret">AAF</abbr>, but you do need to run the ferret DRb server in your production environment. Which gets us to...</p>
<h3>Automating The Starting and Stopping of ferret_server</h3></p>
<p>A few lines of code in your Capistrano <strong>deploy.rb</strong> and you are off and running.
{% highlight ruby %}
before "deploy:start" do
  run "#{current_path}/script/ferret_server -e production start"
end </p>
<p>after "deploy:stop" do
  run "#{current_path}/script/ferret_server -e production stop"
end</p>
<p>after 'deploy:restart' do
  run "cd #{current_path} && ./script/ferret_server -e production stop"
  run "cd #{current_path} && ./script/ferret_server -e production start"
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Except it doesn't work. I ended up with some errors like:
<samp>could not execute command</samp>
<samp>no such file to load -- /usr/bin/../config/environment</samp></p>
<p>It also ends up that it's not Capistrano's fault.</p>
<h3>Acts As Ferret server_manager.rb</h3></p>
<p>In the file <strong>vendor/plugins/acts_as_ferret/lib/server_manager.rb</strong> there is a line that sets up where to look for its environment information. For some reason this is the default:
{% highlight ruby %}
  # require(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../../../../config/environment'))
  require(File.join(File.dirname(ENV['_']), '../config/environment'))
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>If you notice, there is a line commented out. It just so happens that uncommenting that line and commenting out the other fixed the issue for me. It ends up that ENV['_'] points to the base path of the executable and thats <strong>/usr/bin/env</strong>. And that doesn't work. I'm not sure why that's the default behavior.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's easily fixed:
{% highlight ruby %}
  require(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../../../../config/environment'))
  # require(File.join(File.dirname(ENV['_']), '../config/environment'))
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>With that fix in place, the Capistrano deployment will restart the Ferret DRb server when you deploy your application.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>
  According to John in the comments below you can fix the AAF problem without changing the code as well. Just add <code class="inline">default_run_options[:shell] = false</code> to your Capistrano script and that will take care of it.</p>
