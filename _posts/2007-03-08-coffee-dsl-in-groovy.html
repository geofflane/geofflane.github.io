<p>I thought I'd follow up with my previous post with the  <a href="http://www.zorched.net/2007/03/05/understanding-domain-specific-languages-as-jargon/">Coffee Domain Specific Language</a> in the Groovy Language.</p>
<p>This is really one of my first forays into Groovy, so it's pretty rough. It's really just a direct translation of the Ruby code and not what I would expect to be 'idiomatic Groovy'. I'll try and update this once I learn some more Groovy.</p>

// CoffeeDSL.groovy
// This is the input from the user, likely read from a file
// or input through a user interface of some sort
CoffeeInput = "venti nonfat decaf whip latte"
class Coffee
{
  def size
  def whip
  def caf
  def type
  def milk
  public invokeMethod(name)
  {
    if (['venti', 'grande'].contains(name))
      size = name
    else if (['whip', 'nowhip'].contains(name))
      whip = 'whip'.equals(name)
    else if (['caf', 'decaf', 'halfcaf'].contains(name))
      caf = name
    else if (['regular', 'latte', 'cappachino'].contains(name))
      type = name
    else if (['milk', 'nonfat'].contains(name))
      milk = name
    else
    throw new Exception("Unknown coffee informantion: ${name}.")
  }
  public order() {
    def params = ''
    if (milk)
      params += milk + ' '
    if (caf)
      params += caf + ' '
    if (whip)
      params +=  'whip '
    println("Ordering coffee: ${size} ${params}${type}\n")
  }
  public load(input) {
    // turn one line into multi-line "method calls"
    def cleaned = input.split(/\s+/)
    instance_eval(cleaned)
  }
  public instance_eval(methods) {
    for (method in methods) {
      this.invokeMethod(method)
    }
  }
}
// this is your code which loads the DSL input and executes it
coffee = new Coffee()
coffee.load(CoffeeInput)    // load the user input
coffee.order()                 // submit the order
{% endhighlight %}
This isn't even metaprogramming. You could do this in any language, Java, C#, whatever. Everyone talks about metaprogramming in Groovy, but I have not yet found a lot of information on it. Does anyone have any pointers?</p>
