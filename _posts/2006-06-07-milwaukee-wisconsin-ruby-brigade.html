<p>Ok, so I don't know what the name is really going to be, but it looks like there is going to be a Ruby User's group in Milwaukee. There was a kick-off meeting tonight that was well attended for a "getting things started" meeting. Check out the temporary website at <a href="http://ruby.georgey.org/">http://ruby.georgey.org/</a></p>
<p>The first official meeting is going to be July 12th at 6PM.
The meeting will be held at the <a href="http://www.spiderlogic.com">SpiderLogic</a> offices at 10000 Innovation Dr. in Milwaukee (really Wauwatosa near 45 and 94).</p>
<p>The topic so far is going to be "Favorite Features of Ruby". We'll have a tag-team presentation with 4 or 5 people speaking for 5 - 10 minutes each.</p>

Sorry for the lack of posting, we're buying a house and work's been busy.
