<p>The Milwaukee Ruby User's Group had it's first official meeting last night. A few people showed up and we talked about some of our favorite ruby features. I talked about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.devsource.com&#47;article2&#47;0,1895,1928561,00.asp">Metaprogramming<&#47;a> a bit. There was also a good discussion about the Ruby Object Model. (Classes are Objects and Object is a class - holy recursion!)</p>
<p>Check out the site:<br />
