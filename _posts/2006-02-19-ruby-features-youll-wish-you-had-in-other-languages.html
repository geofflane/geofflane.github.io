<p><em>Three Ruby related posts in a row! Yes, I'm currently enamored with this colorful little language.</em></p>
<p>If you know people that know (or you yourself know) languages like Smalltalk
  and Lisp, you'll often hear them curse when they use other languages.
  Something like "Damn, I could do this so much easier in Smalltalk. To do x
  would only take me 2 lines of code!". This is the best reason NOT to learn
  Ruby. Every time you program in other languages you'll think of all the
  little tricks you wish you could use from Ruby. I figured I'd share the pain
  (or at least what I think are some of the cool features).</p>
<h3>Closures and Blocks</h3>
Closures and Blocks are most used in Ruby in dealing with Arrays, Hashes and
other like structures. They can be used in many places, but they are widely
used in library routines for Enumerable types, so you get a lot of built in
examples of that usage.</p>
<p>Does an Array contain a specific item?:
{% highlight ruby %}
me = people.find {  |p| p.first_name == 'Geoff' }
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Find all of elements matching the condition:
{% highlight ruby %}
myfamily = people.select {  |p| p.last_name == 'Lane' }
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Create a new array with the results of running the block on each element (uniq then removes duplicates):
{% highlight ruby %}
all_families = people.collect { |p| p. last_name }.uniq
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>All of that stuff without writing a single Iterator or for loop!</p>
<p>Blocks can be stored as a variable to call later and can be passed as an
  argument to a method. This can give you built-in support for light-weight
  version of patterns like the <a
    href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternStrategy.aspx">Strategy
    Pattern</a> or the <a
    href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternObserver.aspx">Observer
    Pattern</a>.</p>
<p>An Observer for example:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Subject
  def initialize
    @blocks = []
    @state = nil
  end
  def attach(&block)
    @blocks < < block
  end
  def state=(v)
    @state = v
    notify
  end
  private
  def notify
    @blocks.each { |b| b.call(@state) }
  end
end</p>
<p>class Observer
  def called
    puts "Observer called."
  end
end</p>
<p>class Observer2
  def called(state)
    puts "Observer2 was called with '#{state}'."
  end
end</p>
<p>o = Observer.new
o2 = Observer2.new
s = Subject.new
s.attach { o.called }
s.attach { |s| o2.called(s) }
s.state = 'Hi'
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Gives us:</p>
<pre>
Observer called.
Observer2 was called with 'Hi'.
</pre></p>
<p>A Strategy Example:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Mathify
  def initialize(x, y, &block)
    @x = x
    @y = y
    @block = block
  end</p>
<p>  def call
    @block.call(@x, @y)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>
{% highlight ruby %}
add = proc {|a, b| a + b}
mult = proc {|a, b| a * b}
m = Mathify.new(2, 3, &add)
n = Mathify.new(2, 3, &mult)
puts m.call
puts n.call
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<h3>Metaprogramming</h3>
Metaprogramming as the name implies is 'programming your programming'. Using
the dynamic nature of a language like Ruby (or Lisp where much of this
originated), you can programmatically add functionality to your classes or
instances at runtime.</p>
<p>Built-in examples:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name
  attr_reader :person_id
  alias :last_name, :family_name
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p><code class="inline">attr_accessor</code> and <code
    class="inline">attr_reader</code> dynamically create accessors for your
  class. <code class="inline">alias</code> creates another name that
    can be used to access the same attribute.</p>
<p>Ruby has a lot of built-in support for this kind of functionality, but it also allows you to add your own as well:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Module
  def log_call(method, *args)
    old_method = instance_method(method)
    define_method(method) do |*args|
      puts "Calling '#{method}'."
      old_method.bind(self).call(*args)
    end
  end
end</p>
<p>class MyClass
  def call_me
    puts "I've been called."
  end
  def call_me_too
    puts "I've been called too."
  end
  log_call :call_me_too
end</p>
<p>mc = MyClass.new
mc.call_me
mc.call_me_too
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Prints:</p>
<pre>
I've been called.
Calling 'call_me_too'.
I've been called too.
</pre></p>
<p>As you see, I've 'decorated' one of the method calls with some new
  functionality. Basically, I'm dynamically redefining the method to log the
  call prior to passing along the call to the original implementation. You
  could intercept calls to set a 'dirty' flag to know that an instance had been
  changed so that you could do automatic caching.</p>

<h3>Open Classes</h3>
The other thing that this code example shows is that Classes in Ruby are never
closed. You can at any time, open a Class add new methods, redefine methods,
remove methods, anything you want. This is really great for Object Oriented
programming because you can choose where a method resides based on where it is
most appropriate.</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby %}
class Array
  def first_half
    slice(0, size/2)
  end
end
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
puts a.to_s
puts a.first_half.to_s
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Prints:</p>
<pre>
123456
123
</pre></p>
<p>So, if you have special needs to deal with built-in Classes or even just Classes from libraries that you are using, you can put the methods with the Classes where they rightly belong.</p>
<h3>Mixin Modules</h3>
Ruby is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_inheritance">Single-Inheritance</a> language and it does not have Interfaces. Ruby believes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Duck Typing</a>, if it has the right properties and methods, use it. What it has instead of multiple-inheritance or interfaces is Modules.</p>
<p>When you <code>include</code> a Module into a Class, it 'mixes in' its
  properties and methods into the Class. This is widely used in the core Ruby
  classes. <code class="inline">Enumerable</code> is used to implement a whole
  suite of features for interacting with lists of objects. Array and Hash both
  include <code>Enumerable</code> to give them the implementation and interface
  of this code. You can use <code>Enumerable</code> in your own code of course,
  and as with all the other features I've talked about, you can create your own
  as well.</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
module Example
  def contrived
    puts "This is contrived."
  end
end</p>
<p>class Silly
  include Example
end</p>
<p>s = Silly.new
s.contrived
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Prints:</p>
<pre>
This is contrived.
</pre>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Those are some of my favorite features of Ruby, but you really should ignore
them. If not, when you have to programming in Java or .NET you'll be one of
those people saying "Damn, I could do this so much easier in Ruby. To do x
would only take me 2 lines of code!"</p>
