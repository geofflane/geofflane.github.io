<h3>Leopard</h3>
With the new version of Mac OS X announced we can all wait for an early Christmas!
You can order yours early on Amazon for $20 less than you can get it at Apple. How? I don't know, but they give you the discount.</p>
<p>So check order it here:

<h3>iPhone SDK</h3></p>
<p>The other great news is that Apple has finally announced an SDK for the iPhone to be released in February. I think this is a great move. The value of the iPhone is increased dramatically when it can have 3rd Party applications on it  (without all of the trouble from JailBreaking it). The other very interesting news is that the SDK will be available for the iPod Touch as well. This kind of development will have a huge impact on developing the 'ecosystem' around the iPod and the iPhone.</p>
<p>Expect to see a lot of development and uptake of the iPhone early next year. A small computer in your pocket, the Newton 2.0 - this could be some really good stuff.</p>
