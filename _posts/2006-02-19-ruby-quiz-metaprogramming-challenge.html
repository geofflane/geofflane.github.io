<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a> run by James Edward Gray II. It's a weekly 'quiz' that runs on the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20020104.html">ruby-talk</a> mailing list each week. I think this is a great idea for any language, but especially emerging languages full of interesting features like Ruby. </p>
<p>This week's quiz was a meta-programming challenge called <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html">metakoans</a>. This was a really great quiz highlighting a less common, but incredibly powerful feature available in Ruby (which borrowed much of this from Lisp).</p>
