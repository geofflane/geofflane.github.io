<p>One of the big features I keep hearing .NET developers talk about is something called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/">Language Integrated Query</a> (LINQ). LINQ is an Object Query Language (OQL) technology that is slated to be integrated into .NET 3.0. In the general sense an OQL allows you to "query" an object graph much the same way you would query a relational database. LINQ querys even look quite a bit like SQL queries.</p>
<p>The LINQ implementation ends up relying on the introduction of Lambda
  functions in the core .NET 3.0 language. Lambda functions are a powerful way
  of encapsulating a (potentially reusable) block of code. The block of code
  can then be stored in a variable, passed to other methods, etc. As I
  discussed in a previous post <a
    href="http://www.zorched.net/2006/02/19/ruby-features-youll-wish-you-had-in-other-languages/">Ruby
    Features You'll Wish You Had In Other Languages</a>
  these blocks can be used to implement simple patterns like Observer and
  Strategy. They also come in real handy for doing things like sorting and
  filtering lists as you'll see in the example below.</p>
<p>LINQ Query:
{% highlight csharp %}
string[] names = { "Geoff", "Jessica", "Mike", "Megan",
                                    "Priscilla", "Jack", "Alma" };
    IEnumerable<string> expr = from s in names
                               where s.Length == 5
                               orderby s
                               select s.ToUpper();
    foreach (string item in expr)
      Console.WriteLine(item);
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This is a really handy feature.</p>
<p>Ruby has lambda functions, blocks and procs as well as built in support for a lot of filtering of arrays.</p>
<p>{% highlight csharp %}
# define the array
names = [ "Geoff", "Jessica", "Mike", "Megan", "Priscilla",
             "Jack", "Alma" ]
# find all names that are 5 characters long, sort them
# alphabetically and make them uppercase
expr = names.select {
    |n| n.length == 5
}.sort.collect { |n| n.upcase }
# print the results to standard output
expr.each {|n| puts n }
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of Object Oriented languages. The Ruby Way seems much more of
  a natural OO construct to me than the SQL/LINQ type syntax. Fortunately LINQ
  also introduces more of an OO syntax along with lambda functions that Ruby
  people (and Lispers) have come to love.</p>
<p>
  {% highlight csharp %}
Func<string , bool>   filter  = s => s.Length == 5;
Func<string , string> extract = s => s;
Func<string , string> project = s => s.ToUpper();
IEnumerable<string> expr = names.Where(filter)
                                .OrderBy(extract)
                                .Select(project);
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Or the slightly more compact way:</p>
<p>{% highlight csharp %}
IEnumerable<string> expr = names
                           .Where(s => s.Length == 5)
                           .OrderBy(s => s)
                           .Select(s => s.ToUpper());
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This code ends up looking remarkably like the Ruby example above doesn't it?</p>
<p>The power of blocks and lambda functions in Ruby is the fact that they are
  so widely used in the core libraries of the language. They are an integral
  and extremely powerful part of the language so people become used to them
  very quickly. Only time will tell how well integrated the LINQ concepts are
  into the core .NET languages. Hopefully it will be better integrated than the
  Generics where in the Collections classes (where they created an entirely new
  namespace for the Generic collections instead of extending the existing
  ones). I look forward to this new addition to the .NET family of languages.
  But you don't have to wait to try these interesting and powerful features if
  you check out Ruby. Oh, and Ruby runs on the .NET CLR today, so check out <a
    href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2006/03/16/third-drop-of-rubyclr">Ruby
    CLR</a> too.</p>
